    I am a young coder who has at the moment designed and programmed one game: Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe - a 39 year-old sequel to the original Infocom game the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (designed and programmed by Douglas Adams himself and Steve Meretzky, author of games such Leather Goddesses of Phobos, A Mind Forever Voyaging and Planetfall).
    At the moment I am working on my next game, WITHOUT, a dark humour piece which is not about you.

    I code mainly using ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) for my IF pieces; and have limited skills in Python/Pygame, but I can still use it well enough.
    You will find me most responsive on intfiction.org.
