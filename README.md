I am a young coder, working on (or finished with) Milliways: the Restaurant at the End of the Universe - a 39 year-old sequel to the original Infocom game the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I can code in ZIL (Zork Implementation Language), and minimal skills in Python/Pygame, but I can still use it to my knowledge.
You will find me most responsive on intfiction.org.
